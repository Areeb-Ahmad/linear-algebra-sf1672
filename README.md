## 📖 About This Project

This repository contains a comprehensive set of notes, proofs, and definitions for Linear Algebra. I created this compendium to move beyond simply memorizing formulas and instead build a deep, first-principles understanding of the subject. The document is structured to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical definitions and their geometric interpretations, covering everything from basic vector operations to advanced topics like eigenspaces and orthogonality.
